-Keep logic and GUI elements seperate, and only update GUI elements when out-of-combat so as to prevent 
"Interface Action Failed Due to an Addon" messages.

-Configuration should be saved by character

-Cryolysis3.lua should only have OnEnable(), OnInitialize(), and OnDisable() (and possibly module loading/LOD functions)

Folder Breakdown...
/classes/	Integrated class modules.
/core/		Core functions that provide frameworks for other bits to interface with.
/data/		Files and functions relevant to data collecting or storing.
/modules/	Integrated modules (stuff from Cryo2 mainly).
/textures/	Skins.	

To-do:
Split locales to match folder structure (one file for each class/module)
